# MakeCode-for-Kids
A collection of simple MakeCode samples to be used with kids for a basic class on programming
We want to create a series of simple exercises to learn how to program using MakeCode and Minecraft

We start with a session on the basics of MakeCode: how to install, how to connect with Minecraft, the editor, the basics of the blocks etc. We did not use slides but as a reference you can watch Jacqueline Russel in this Channel9 video https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Seth-Juarez/Introducing-Microsoft-MakeCode-for-Minecraft

Session 1 is about the basics of programming, including loops, agent, blocks

Session 2 is about using the commands learned in Session 1 to make something more fun

Session 3 is about learning more complex instructions to build a house

Session 4 is about mastering the code and building a fun game with it

We would love to build even more sessions, but our time is limited so if you want to join, shout!
